# Secure_Interpreter_Ocaml
Trusted execution environment of a functional language, written in OCAML. I have implemented also an enclave mechanism, a static type system, a security static type system for Information Flow to enforce confidentiality and a dynamic taint analysis to enforce integrity. Further information can be found in the code documentation and the report.pdf file.
